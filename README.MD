I developed this for my teacher, but since he didn't even look into it, I'm making this as open source

This compiles under .net 4.5

If you don't have it installed, there is a setup file in *Scoreboard It!* folder.

This application is useful for scoring. All instructions are provided in the application itself.

This code is not *so optimized* but it does what it is intended to do.

For those, who do not want to mess with the code, there is a compiled version under *Compiled* folder. Click setup and you'll have the application running

Happy Coding :)
